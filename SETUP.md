# Setup

We will use Jupyter Notebooks for all exercises. There are several ways to set up a Jupyter environment for running the exercises:

## 1. CSC’s Notebooks

*The default option.* CSC’s Notebooks (https://notebooks.csc.fi) provides easy-to-use environments for working with data and programming. You can access everything via your web browser and CSC cloud environment computes on the background.

* Point your browser to https://notebooks.csc.fi
* Login using Haka (or using Alternate login and a separate username and password) 
* Find *Course Practical Machine Learning 2019* and click “Launch new”
* Wait until the “Open in browser” link appears, then click on it
* The jupyterlab notebook dashboard should appear
* If you are not familiar with Jupyter, take a moment to get to know the interface
    * open a new notebook using the Launcher (click on *Notebook: Python 3*) 
    * write some Python code to a Jupyter *cell*
    * execute the cell with *shift-enter*
* Exercise 1: Navigate to `python-introduction/notebooks/examples` and go through the notebooks *1 - Introduction.ipynb* and *7 - NumPy.ipynb*.
* Other exercises: Navigate to `intro-to-ml` where all the exercise notebooks are located
    
## 2. Running Jupyter on your laptop

If you have a laptop that has Jupyter, Scikit-learn, and all the other necessary Python packages installed, it is possible to use it. Clone the Git repositories used on this course

    git clone https://github.com/csc-training/python-introduction
    git clone https://github.com/csc-training/intro-to-ml
    
and launch Jupyter.
